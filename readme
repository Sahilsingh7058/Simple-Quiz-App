🧩 My Learning

While building this project, I learned how to:
🧱 Use HTML to create structured and accessible web layouts.
🎨 Apply CSS for responsive design and button feedback (correct/incorrect states).
⚙️ Write JavaScript logic to dynamically load questions and handle user interaction.
🔄 Implement event listeners for button clicks and quiz restarts.
💡 Understand DOM manipulation, loops, and conditionals in real use cases.
🧠 Manage application state (current question, score, and progress) efficiently.
This project helped strengthen my core web development skills and gave me confidence in writing clean, functional vanilla JavaScript code.

💡 Future Enhancements
⏱️ Add a timer for each question.
📈 Show progress bar or question counter.
🧍 Store high scores using localStorage.
🖼️ Add images, sounds, or animations for better engagement.
🌐 Support multiple quiz categories or difficulty levels.
